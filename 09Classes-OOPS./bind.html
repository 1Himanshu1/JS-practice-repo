<!-- 

I found an Interesting concept regarding 'this' that it does not overrides the content of 'this' in callback function:-
In JavaScript, the bind() method creates a new function that, when invoked, has its this value explicitly set to the value provided as an argument to bind(). It doesn't override this in the original function; rather, it creates a new function with a bound context. -->
